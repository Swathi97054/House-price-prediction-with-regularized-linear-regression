# House-price-prediction-with-regularized-linear-regression

The goal is to predict housing prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc., using linear regression while applying regularization to improve performance.

Predicting housing prices is a common problem in machine learning, and regularized linear regression is a powerful method to handle this task. Regularization helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients in the model, improving generalization to unseen data.



The process is done as follows
